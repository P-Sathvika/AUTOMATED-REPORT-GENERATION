# Description
This Python script reads data from a CSV file, performs basic statistical analysis, and generates a PDF report with the analysis results.

1. Read Data: It loads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame using read_data().

2. Analyze Data: It computes the mean, sum, and descriptive statistics of the data with analyze_data().

3. Generate PDF Report: It creates a PDF report using FPDF, which includes:

A title and summary of the data.

Statistical insights (mean, sum, and description).

Optional histograms (graphs) generated for each numeric column.

4. Plot Data: The plot_data() function creates histograms for each numeric column using matplotlib and saves them as PNG images, which are then included in the PDF.

5. Main Function: The main() function orchestrates the process by reading the data, analyzing it, and generating the PDF report.

The script is designed to automate the analysis and reporting of datasets with minimal manual intervention.
